                <p>Hi, I’m Gavin Mallott. I’m a student, programmer and problem solver from Minnesota. </p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p>I am a student, programmer, and problem solver. I was drawn to programming, and subsequently my passion for computers, because I enjoy solving problems. For me, computer programming is simply an extension of my real-world problem solving skills. When I’m presented a problem I tackle it using logic, critical thinking, and experimentation.</p>

                    <p>Some examples of problems I have solved include making computer programs to calculate mathematical and chemical equations. Most of the time these problems come from school, for example, a chemistry worksheet. When I can make a computer program to solve the problems for me, I know then I truly have a mastery over the subject.</p>

                    <p>My love of solving problems has fed into my love of learning. From a young age I have wanted to learn as much about everything as possible, because the more I know, the more problems I can solve. To quote Albert Einstein, “No problem can be solved by the same consciousness that created it.”</p>
                    
                    <p>When I am not in front of a computer, I enjoy spending my time outdoors and with my family and friends. Living in Minnesota, there are always plenty of fun things to do outside, be it hiking, camping, or swimming. The most important thing for me, however, is the relationships I have with my friends and family, as they are the source of my inspiration and motivation.</p>
